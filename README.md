**CleanDiffuser** is an easy-to-use modularized Diffusion Model library tailored for decision-making, which comprehensively integrates different types of diffusion algorithmic branches. CleanDiffuser offers a variety of advanced *diffusion models*, *network structures*, diverse *conditions*, and *algorithm pipelines* in a simple and user-friendly manner. Inheriting the design philosophy of [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) and [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), CleanDiffuser emphasizes **usability, simplicity, and customizability**. We hope that CleanDiffuser will serve as a foundational tool library, providing long-term support for Diffusion Model research in the decision-making community, facilitating the application of research for scientists and practitioners alike. The highlight features of CleanDiffuser are:

- üöÄ Amazing features specially tailored for decision-making tasks
- üçß Support for multiple advanced diffusion models and network architectures
- üß© Build decoupled modules into integrated pipelines easily like building blocks
- üìà Wandb logging and Hydra configuration
- üåè Unified environmental interface and efficient dataloader

We strongly recommend reading [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09509) and [documents](https://cleandiffuserteam.github.io/CleanDiffuserDocs/) to learn more about CleanDiffuser and its design philosophy.

<!-- NEWS -->
## üî• News and Change Log

- [**2024-06-24**] ü•∞ We have added Consistency Models into CleanDiffuser. With one model, you can do both Consistency Distillation and Consistency Training! Check out an example in `tutorials/sp_consistency_policy.py`! (Note: Our consistency training implementation refers to the improved version, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14189.)
- [**2024-06-20**] üõ†Ô∏è We have prepared dependency requirements for **Tutorial**, **RL**, and **IL** environments to avoid compatibility issues.
- [**2024-06-17**] üî• We released arxiv version of [**CleanDiffuser: An Easy-to-use Modularized Library for Diffusion Models in Decision Making**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09509). 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

We recommend installing and experiencing CleanDiffuser through a Conda virtual environment.

First, install the dependencies related to the mujoco-py environment. For more details, see https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco

```bash
sudo apt-get install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 patchelf
```

Download CleanDiffuser and add this folder to your PYTHONPATH. You can also add it to .bashrc for convenience:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CleanDiffuserTeam/CleanDiffuser.git
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/CleanDiffuser
```

Install the Conda virtual environment and PyTorch:
```bash
conda create -n cleandiffuser python==3.9
conda activate cleandiffuser
# pytorch
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
# pytorch3d
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
pip install --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py39_cu113_pyt1121/download.html
```

> **Note:** 
> 
> Due to compatibility issues, we have separate installation for the *Tutorial*, *RL* and *IL* environments, and **we recommend running them with different virtual environments**. (The *Tutorial* and *RL* installation processes can be compatible.)

### Installation for Tutorials

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl@master#egg=d4rl
pip install -r requirements/req_tutorials.txt
```

Try it now!   
```bash
python tutorials/1_a_minimal_DBC_implementation.py
```

### Installation for RL Environments (D4RL)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl@master#egg=d4rl
pip install -r requirements/req_rl.txt
```

Try it now!   
```bash
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py
```

### Installation for IL Environments (Pusht, Relay Kitchen and Robomimic)

Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements/req_il.txt
pip install setuptools==65.5.0 pip==21  # gym 0.21 installation is broken with more recent versions
pip install gym==0.21.0
```

Download the corresponding dataset (take `pusht` as an example):  
```bash
mkdir dev && cd dev
wget https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/data/training/pusht.zip  # download pusht dataset
unzip pusht.zip && rm -f pusht.zip && cd ..
```

Try it now!  
```bash
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py
```

If you need to reproduce more Imitation Learning environments (`pusht`, `kitchen`, `robomimic`), you need to download the datasets additionally. We recommend downloading the corresponding compressed files from [Datasets](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/data/training/). We provide the default dataset path as `dev/`:

```bash
dev/
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kitchen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pusht
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robomimic
```

<!-- TUTORIALS -->
## üç∑ Tutorials

We will make every effort to provide detailed `tutorials` for beginners in the field of **Diffusion Models in Decision Making**, which is also beneficial for learning the core components of CleanDiffuser and expanding them into new algorithms. **Our vision is not only to offer a benchmark for the community but more importantly, to enable everyone to implement and innovate diffusion algorithms more easily based on CleanDiffuser.**  

> **Note:** 
> 
> In the `tutorials`, we generally only explain and demonstrate individual mechanisms or components, rather than a complete algorithm, and therefore ignore the extra tricks and take just a few minutes of training time. This may cause performance drop, which is normal!

We have now provided the following tutorials and are continuously updating more:

```bash
# Build the DiffusionBC algorithm with minimal code
python tutorials/1_a_minimal_DBC_implementation.py
# Customize classifier-free guidance
python tutorials/2_classifier-free_guidance.py
# Customize classifier guidance
python tutorials/3_classifier_guidance.py
# Customize diffusion network backbone
python tutorials/4_customize_your_diffusion_network_backbone.py
```

If you wish to reproduce the results of the paper perfectly, we recommend using the full implementation in `pipelines`.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## üíª Pipelines

The `cleandiffuser` folder contains the core components of the CleanDiffuser codebase, including `Diffusion Models`, `Network Architectures`, and `Guided Sampling`. It also provides unified `Env and Dataset Interfaces`.

In CleanDiffuser, we can combine independent modules to algorithms pipelines like building blocks. In the `pipelines` folder, we provide all the algorithms currently implemented in CleanDiffuser. By linking with the Hydra configurations in the `configs` folder, you can reproduce the results presented in the papers:

You can simply run each algorithm with the default environment and configuration without any additional setup, for example:

```bash
# DiffusionPolicy with Chi_UNet in lift-ph
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py
# Diffuser in halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py
```

Thanks to Hydra, CleanDiffuser also supports flexible running of algorithms through CLI or directly modifying the corresponding configuration files. We provide some examples:

```bash
# Load PushT config
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py --config-path=../configs/dp/pusht/dit --config-name=pusht
# Load PushT config and overwrite some hyperparameters
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py --config-path=../configs/dp/pusht/dit --config-name=pusht dataset_path=path/to/dataset seed=42 device=cuda:1
# Train Diffuser in hopper-medium-v2 task
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py task=hopper-medium-v2 
```

In CleanDiffuser, we provide a mode option to switch between **training** `(mode=train)` or **inference** `(mode=inference)` of the model:

```bash
# Imitation learning environment
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py mode=inference model_path=path/to/checkpoint
# Reinforcement learning environment
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py mode=inference ckpt=latest
```
